My PhD research aims to identify effective conservation measures for parrots, many of which face a range of threats which impact on population size and viability. Parrots can be very long-lived and little is known about how some aspects of their life history, such as the strong monogamous pair bonding in many species, influences population dynamics. I use population modelling techniques to explore how different processes, in particular pair bonding based on individual quality, may affect transient and long-term population responses.

I am also researching methods which may improve the performance of population models for species where life history data is sparse or missing, as is often the case for species of conservation concern. Demographic data gaps are often filled using available data from related species, but it is unclear how substituting life history data for different species affects the projections from the resulting models. I am investigating how using a novel phylogenetic method for imputing the missing values in demographic data may improve estimates of population metrics. I aim to apply this method to a case study of the Yellow-shouldered amazon, _Amazona barbadensis_, for which accurate estimates of survival are lacking.
