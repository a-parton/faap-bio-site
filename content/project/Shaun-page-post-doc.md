I am modelling the evolution of herbicide resistance in black grass (*Alopecurus myosuroides*) and applying optimisation tools to those models to find better integrated weed management strategies. I have a wide range of other research interests centred around demography and invasive species management, [click here for more details](http://shauncouttsecology.com/).
